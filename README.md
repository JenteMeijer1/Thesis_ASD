# Thesis_ASD

In these folders the code used for the analyses and visualisation of the Thesis with the title "Towards understanding heterogeneity in autism: identifying clinical subgroups and neuroanatomical deviations using normative models"

The code for clustering can be found in the Rstudio script folder.
Here we also prepare the data for the normative model. 
The normative modelling is done in the python scripts. Here you can find the code for the main analysis and also for the sensitivity analysis and the mega model.
All visualisations are also done in these python scripts. However, analysis is done in the R scripts. The classification (SVM) is done in python and can be found in the python_scripts folder. 
In the python_scripts folder, you can find the requirements for the environments used for the normative model and the classification.
