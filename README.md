# Thesis_ASD

In this directory, the scripts used for the master thesis of Jente Meijer are shown. These scripts are used for the analyses and the visualisations.
The scripts were used to identify subgroups in autism, show CT differences between these subgroups using normative modelling and use classification algorithms. We switch in these scripts between R and Python.
R is used to identify the subgroups and do all statistical analyses. Python is used for the normative model, visualisation on the brain, and the SVM classification.
